# Planning (with Fibonacci estimates)

## Phase 2: Good routing, public demo.

* **DONE** Setup bower to download directly into /public (for now). Hook up in index.html.
* angular-ui-router: Implement a routing/view system more flexible than ng-view.
* Setup angodo.maclure.com.au, deploy app there.

## Phase 1: Getting Started (Started: 02Apr13)

* **DONE** Create the base project files in a git repository. (1)
* **DONE** Download Angular minified, and get running in an index.html page. (1)
* **DONE** Create and push project on github. (1)
* **DONE** Setup TodoListController with mocked data, render using ng-repeat directive in 2 lists. (3)
* **DONE** Implement routing as per step 07 in tutorial. Weaknesses here. (2)
* **DONE** Update model as user types (1)

## Backlog

* Add RequireJS for loading dependencies in JS.
* Add jQuery to the app. Required for angular-ui at the moment.
* Add karma test runner to the app. Write some basic tests.
* Consider: Add meteor to the project, use for persisting/sharing data (and to learn meteor).
* Add http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ to the app, for a polished UI. Get rid of Pure.
