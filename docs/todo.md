# Planning

## Phase 2: Good routing

* Setup bower to download directly into /public (for now).
* Select and implement a routing/view system more flexible than ng-view.

## Phase 1: Getting Started (Started: 02Apr13)

* **DONE** Create the base project files in a git repository.
* **DONE** Download Angular minified, and get running in an index.html page.
* **DONE** Create and push project on github.
* **DONE** Setup TodoListController with mocked data, render using ng-repeat directive in 2 lists.
* **DONE** Implement routing as per step 07 in tutorial. Weaknesses here.
* **DONE** Update model as user types

## Backlog

* Add jQuery to the app. Required for angular-ui at the moment.
* Add karma test runner to the app. Write some basic tests.
* Add RequireJS for loading dependencies in JS.
