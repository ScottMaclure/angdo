## First impressions?

Ang's website is a fantastic resource.

Example: the tutorial: http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00

I really like the idea of writing all my docs in markdown.

Keeping all input in one client application (code editor) is nice. Can output to HTML later using Jekyll.

## The Scope achieves data binding

_The concept of a scope in Angular is crucial; a scope can be seen as the glue which allows the template, model and controller to work together. Angular uses scopes, along with the information contained in the template, data model, and controller, to keep models and views separate, but in sync. Any changes made to the model are reflected in the view; any changes that occur in the view are reflected in the model._

## What is the "model" in AngularJS?

Backbone has Collections and Models, which emit events when changed etc. They provide a RESTful API for updating to the server.

How does angular achieve this in a structured manner?
