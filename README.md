# Angdo - AngularJS Todo

Learning AngularJS through progressive feature enhancement.

## Goals

Progressively build a functioning multi-user TODO system.

Adapt some best practices while I'm at it.

## Key Concepts

* Automate the toolchain.
* Don't be afraid of refactoring.
* Keep everything in the repo: code, tests, documentation. The repo is all.

## Installation

* Clone git repo to ~/dev/projects/angdo
* Add angdo.local to /etc/hosts
* Create /etc/apache2/sites-available/angdo, using [docs/apache-vhost.conf].
* sudo a2ensite angdo

## Planning

See [docs/project-plan.md] for details.

## Conclusion

Write my thoughts here as I progress.
